                Hello! My name is Melody, and I am a senior undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm currently majoring in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Design and another minor in Human-Computer Interaction. I have previous experience in robotics and mechanical design, and I'm looking for any opportunities that will give me more experience in mechanical, industrial, or product design.
