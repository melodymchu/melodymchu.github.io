    <h3>About The Assignment</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Design Intent and Challenges:</strong><br>
        The MockingJay Chair is a thoughtfully designed portable airline seat tailored for children aged 5-12. Created for Oceanic Express flights, this project addresses common challenges faced by young travelers and their parents. The design incorporates features to enhance comfort, portability, and functionality, making flights easier and more enjoyable for both kids and their guardians. During the design process, our team conducted interviews with parents to identify key issues children face while traveling, such as short attention spans, limited carrying capacity, and the need for easy setup and disassembly. With these challenges in mind, we aimed to create a chair that not only serves as a comfortable seat but also acts as an all-in-one solution to keep children entertained and independent.

    <h3>Ideation Phase</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Key Features</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> The chair folds down to a compact size, smaller than standard carry-on luggage, and includes built-in wheels for easy maneuvering by young children. The lightweight yet durable design ensures that kids can roll it effortlessly through the airport.</li>
            <li><strong>Innovative Desk Design:</strong> To cater to the entertainment needs of young users, the chair includes a detachable desk. This desk offers a convenient space for drawing, playing with toys, or holding a device. The desk securely slides into a storage bag when not in use, reducing the risk of small fingers getting caught in folding mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Sturdy and Intuitive Setup:</strong> The chair’s simple folding and unfolding mechanism, supported by four sturdy latches and strong paracord, ensures both stability and ease of use. This design allows children to independently set up and pack down the chair without assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Built-in Storage:</strong> With an integrated storage bag as large as the chair’s backrest, the MockingJay provides ample space for toys, snacks, and personal belongings, accessible even when the chair is folded.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Prototyping and Testing:</strong><br>
        Throughout the project, we followed an iterative design process, creating low-fidelity prototypes to test core concepts and refine our ideas. After validating our design, we built a full-scale prototype using wood for durability, with the understanding that mass production would use lighter materials like aluminum. The final prototype demonstrated the chair's potential to meet our design goals, while our research-based features were proven to be effective and user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Project Outcome:</strong><br>
        The MockingJay Chair successfully addresses key pain points for young travelers, including portability, independence, and entertainment. It offers a unique solution not seen in traditional child seating options, emphasizing user-centered design, safety, and ease of use.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>My Role:</strong><br>
        As a member of the MockingJay design team, I collaborated on ideation, feature definition, and prototype testing. I contributed to refining the chair’s features through research and feedback, helping bring this innovative idea to life.
