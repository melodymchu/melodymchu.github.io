                    <!-- Project Description -->
                    <p class="project-description">For the CMU 112 Hackathon, my team created a cute pet-simulator game, incorporating sentiment analysis and web-scraping. I was responsible for designing the visual elements of the project. This project won 1st place among 18 teams, with over 100 participants.</p>

        <!-- Ideation Phase Section -->
        <h3>Ideation Phase</h3>
        <p>During the ideation phase, we brainstormed features for our pet-simulator while keeping the tight 19-hour deadline in mind. We aimed for a simple base idea that could be expanded with additional features depending on the available time. We decided on a pet simulator that analyzes user input text for sentiment and reacts accordingly, providing flexibility in our development process.</p>

        <!-- Prototyping Section -->
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>My main role was designing the UI/UX, in addition to contributing to the ideation and debugging in Python. I began by creating the main sprite, a dog, and its various emotional expressions using Adobe Fresco on an iPad. Several layout options were also designed, evolving with the addition of new features like manual sleep, feed, and play buttons.</p>
        <p>The overall aesthetic was kept simple, cartoony, and playful, reminiscent of childhood pet games, with minimal shading and a light, colorful palette.</p>

        <!-- Final Result Section -->
        <h3>Final Result</h3>
        <p>The final pet simulator included the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customize Your Dog:</strong> Users can enter their name, their dog's name, and choose a color for the dog using Tkinter colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Dog's Emotions:</strong> The dog has 7 different emotion sprites that react based on emotion levels (e.g., Super Happy, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Bored, Tired, Sleepy).</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Status Bars:</strong> Display the pet's levels of happiness, hunger, entertainment, sleep, and overall emotion, all of which change based on user interactions and time.</li>
            <li><strong>Fetch Feature:</strong> Using web scraping, the game can fetch images of items specified by the user and display them in the UI.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- User Interaction and Sentiment Analysis Section -->
        <h3>User Interaction and Sentiment Analysis</h3>
        <p>User inputs affect the dog's emotions through sentiment analysis. Positive text increases happiness, while negative text decreases it. The manual buttons for feeding, playing, and sleeping directly affect the corresponding status bars, encouraging continuous interaction to maintain the dog's happiness.</p>

        <!-- Expo Presentation Section -->
        <h3>Expo Presentation and Feedback</h3>
        <p>For the final submission, we presented a video and demonstrated the game live at an expo. The interactive and easy-to-play nature of the game engaged many participants, who enjoyed experimenting with different actions to influence the dog's behavior. The quick decay of emotion levels encouraged continuous play to keep the dog happy. Our project was well-received, earning first place in the hackathon!</p>

        <!-- Reflection Section -->
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Despite the stressful time constraints, the hackathon was a rewarding experience. My team and I created a fun, engaging, and wholesome project that many people enjoyed. The success of our pet simulator at the hackathon reaffirmed the importance of good UI/UX design and interactive elements in making a project stand out.</p>
