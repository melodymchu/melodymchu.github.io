                        <!-- Project Description -->
                        <p class="project-description">For the CMU 112 Hackathon, my team created a cute pet-simulator
                            game, incorporating sentiment analysis and web-scraping. I was responsible for designing the
                            visual elements of the project. This project won 1st place among 18 teams, with over 100
                            participants.</p>

            <!-- Ideation Phase Section -->
            <h3>Ideation Phase</h3>
            <p>During the ideation phase, we brainstormed features for our pet-simulator while keeping the tight 19-hour
                deadline in mind. We aimed for a simple base idea that could be expanded with additional features
                depending on the available time. We decided on a pet simulator that analyzes user input text for
                sentiment and reacts accordingly, providing flexibility in our development process.</p>

            <!-- Prototyping Section -->
            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
            <p>My main role was designing the UI/UX, in addition to contributing to the ideation and debugging in
                Python. I began by creating the main sprite, a dog, and its various emotional expressions using Adobe
                Fresco on an iPad. Several layout options were also designed, evolving with the addition of new features
                like manual sleep, feed, and play buttons.</p>
            <p>The overall aesthetic was kept simple, cartoony, and playful, reminiscent of childhood pet games, with
                minimal shading and a light, colorful palette.</p>

            <!-- Final Result Section -->
            <h3>Final Result</h3>
            <p>The final pet simulator included the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Customize Your Dog:</strong> Users can enter their name, their dog's name, and choose a
                    color for the dog using Tkinter colors.</li>
                <li><strong>Dog's Emotions:</strong> The dog has 7 different emotion sprites that react based on emotion
                    levels (e.g., Super Happy, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Bored, Tired, Sleepy).</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Status Bars:</strong> Display the pet's levels of happiness, hunger, entertainment,
                    sleep, and overall emotion, all of which change based on user interactions and time.</li>
                <li><strong>Fetch Feature:</strong> Using web scraping, the game can fetch images of items specified by
                    the user and display them in the UI.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/Main-UI.png" alt="Main UI with Dog Sprite and Controls"
                class="project-image">

            <!-- Sentiment Analysis Section -->
            <h3>User Interaction and Sentiment Analysis</h3>
            <p>User inputs affect the dog's emotions through sentiment analysis. Positive text increases happiness,
                while negative text decreases it. The manual buttons for feeding, playing, and sleeping directly affect
                the corresponding status bars, encouraging continuous interaction to maintain the dog's happiness.</p>

            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/sentiment-analysis-sad.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars"
                class="project-image">

            <!-- Customizability -->
            <h3>CUSTOMIZE YOUR DOG:</h3>
            <p>User first enters their name, their dog's name, and what color they'd like the color to be (using Tkinter
                colors)</p>
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/sentiment-analysis-happy.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars"

                class="project-image">


            <!-- Emotions -->
            <h3>DOG'S EMOTIONS:</h3>
            <p>Dog has 7 emotion sprites that react to emotion levels</p>
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/emote_SUPER_happy.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars" class="project-image">
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/emote_happy.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars" class="project-image">
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/emote_neutral.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars" class="project-image">
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/emote_sad.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars" class="project-image">
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/emote_bored.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars" class="project-image">
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/emote_tired.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars" class="project-image">
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/emote_sleepy.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars" class="project-image">

            <h3> DYNAMIC STATUS BARS:</h3>
            <p>Display pet's levels of happiness, hunger, entertainment, sleep, overall emotion.
                Happiness reacts to entertainment level and sentiment analysis of text that user inputs into textboxâ€‹,
                (i.e. if you say something positive, like "good boy," happiness increases)
                Hunger reacts to manual feed button and decreases over time

                Entertainment reacts to how much interaction is received (button presses, entering text), decreases over
                time

                Sleep reacts to manual sleep button and decreases over time

                Emotion reacts to other 4 status bars
            </p>
            <img src="images/Pet-Simulator/dynamic-status-bars.png" alt="Emotions and Status Bars"
                class="project-image">

            <h3> FETCH:</h3>
            <p>If text box detects "get item" or "fetch item" (e.g. "fetch ball"), it'll use webscraping to search
                Google images for an image of item and display it in front of the dog

                User inputs "fetch item"
                Program uses webscraping to find a png of requested item
                Displays item png in main UI in front of dog
            </p>

            Overall, although the time pressure of the hackathon was stressful, I found this experience very enjoyable
            because my team and I got to create a cute, lighthearted, wholesome project that other people were able to
            enjoy too.

            <!-- Expo Presentation Section -->
            <h3>Expo Presentation and Feedback</h3>
            <p>For the final submission, we presented a video and demonstrated the game live at an expo. The interactive
                and easy-to-play nature of the game engaged many participants, who enjoyed experimenting with different
                actions to influence the dog's behavior. The quick decay of emotion levels encouraged continuous play to
                keep the dog happy. Our project was well-received, earning first place in the hackathon!</p>

            <!-- Reflection Section -->
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Despite the stressful time constraints, the hackathon was a rewarding experience. My team and I created a
                fun, engaging, and wholesome project that many people enjoyed. The success of our pet simulator at the
                hackathon reaffirmed the importance of good UI/UX design and interactive elements in making a project
                stand out.</p>
