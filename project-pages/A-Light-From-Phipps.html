                            <p class="project-description">I designed this floor lamp as an homage to the Phipps
                                Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in Pittsburgh, PA, to capture the natural beauty and
                                architectural sophistication of the site. Through extensive research into its imagery,
                                history, and the lighting market, I created a design that blends organic forms with
                                architectural elements and materials reflective of the iconic conservatory.</p>

                <!-- Research and Inspiration Section -->
                <h3>Research and Inspiration</h3>
                <p>The design process began with a comprehensive study of the Phipps Conservatory's imagery and history.
                    By analyzing the conservatory's architecture and botanical themes, I developed a concept for a lamp
                    that incorporates both organic and architectural forms. This inspiration guided the initial sketches
                    and CAD models, blending natural curves with structured design elements to create a visually
                    harmonious product.</p>

                <!-- Final Design Section -->
                <h3>Final Design</h3>

                <p>The final lamp design captures the essence of the Phipps Conservatory with its elegant form and
                    thoughtful use of materials. The lamp's base and shade mimic the conservatory's glass and steel
                    structure, while the organic curves reflect the natural beauty of the plants housed within. The use
                    of sustainable materials and LED technology further enhances the design, aligning with modern trends
                    in environmentally conscious product design.</p>

                <!-- Final Presentation Section -->
                <h3>Final Presentation</h3>
                <p>The project culminated in a final presentation, where I showcased the design process, research
                    insights, and the final product. The presentation highlighted the integration of architectural and
                    natural elements, as well as the product's potential appeal in the current market. Feedback from
                    peers and instructors emphasized the project's strong conceptual foundation and effective execution.

                <!-- Reflection Section -->
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>This project was a valuable experience in blending artistic inspiration with practical design
                    considerations. By capturing the essence of a well-known Pittsburgh landmark in a commercial
                    product, I learned the importance of thorough research, iterative design, and effective visual
                    communication. These lessons will inform my future projects, as I continue to explore the
                    intersection of design, architecture, and nature.</p>
