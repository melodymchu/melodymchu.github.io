                    <!-- Project Description -->
                    <p class="project-description">In the Manual Machining Class, we learned about common manual machining shop tools, like manual mills, lathes, and saws. We used these tools and subtractive manufacturing techniques to create a phone stand from a block and rod of aluminum. We also used techniques such as edge-finding and threading holes. The end goal was to match an engineering drawing, with dimensions within 5% tolerance.</p>

        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>The goal of this project was to manufacture a phone stand using manual machining methods. We were provided with an engineering drawing and required to fabricate the stand to match specified dimensions within a 5% tolerance. The process involved using a manual knee mill to cut and shape the base, and a lathe to fabricate vertical pegs that would serve as supports for the phone. Each part was then threaded to allow for assembly, and the final product was finished using a sandblaster.</p>

        <h3>Manufacturing Process</h3>
        <p>The project began with the selection of raw materials: a block and rod of aluminum. Using the manual knee mill, I carefully cut and shaped the base of the stand. Edge-finding techniques were employed to ensure precision, and holes were drilled and threaded to accommodate the pegs. The vertical pegs were crafted using a lathe, where they were cut to length and threaded to screw into the base securely.</p>
