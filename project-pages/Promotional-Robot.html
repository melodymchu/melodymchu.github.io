                        I designed and manufactured this Promotional Robot as a way to store and display my high school robotics team's promotional stickers and business cards during competitions and community outreaches. Business cards were held in the robot's hands, and a roll of stickers was stored inside the body and came out of the mouth, like a tape dispenser. This robot was also passed around during our community outreaches to demonstrate what a 3D-printed object can look like.

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>
            While I was the marketing lead for my robotics team, I designed a lot of promotional materials, such as team stickers and business cards, and we wanted a better way to store, distribute, and display them for people to take during competitions, community outreaches, and general presentations. Since it was for a robotics team, I thought it'd be fitting to create a robot-shaped stand.
        </p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
            To flesh out the design, I created a 3D CAD model in Autodesk Inventor. The business cards are pretty straightforward: they just sit in the robot's hands, like the robot is holding them for you. I made the hands wide for stability, with the top "finger" smaller than the bottom so they can rest at a slight angle. I also made the hands sit close to the body so the business cards can also rest against the body if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the stickers, I decided to make the system similar to a tape dispenser: the inside of the body and head is hollow to store a roll of stickers, which can then be fed through and dispensed through the mouth. The head and body are detachable for ease of restocking.
        </p>

        <h3>Manufacture</h3>
        <p>
            The CAD model was converted to an STL file which was then sliced and sent to the team's 3D printer to be made. We used a mix of yellow and blue PLA filament. The arms were then glued into place, and I cut yellow vinyl for the eyes to add some contrast in the face. During this process, I learned that 3D printing can sometimes take a pretty long time (hours). When I printed the body of the robot, which is basically a large box, I learned that 3D printing may not always be the best option, especially if the part is not geometrically complex, as it does take a long time and a lot of filament to print. Time to manufacture and cost of material are important considerations for future projects!
        </p>

        <h3>Final Result</h3>
        <p>
            This was my first time 3D printing something that I designed, and I thought it was such a cool and rewarding experience! Working with the other team members to learn how 3D printers work and how to use them, was very fun, and learning this new skill made me more interested and less intimidated in the technical aspects of the team. I learned that 3D printing can basically make almost any CAD model real, and works best for complex geometries.
        </p>
        <p>
            My team made use of this promotional robot by setting it out for people to take stickers and business cards during competitions and outreaches (as intended!). An unexpected use of this was also to emphasize to judges how much our team uses 3D printing, since we also use 3D prints throughout our actual competition robot. This promotional robot also became a useful prop to pass around during community presentations and workshops to demonstrate what a 3D printed object can look like (i.e. layers of plastic can make complex 3D geometries and useful items). Overall, I am very pleased with this design because it was useful for us in distributing promotional materials, helpful for others when trying to understand 3D printing, and is also just a cute addition to our display.
