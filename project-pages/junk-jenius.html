                            The Junk Jenius: Plastic Bottle Recycling Machine is designed to make recycling <i>easy,
                                accessible, and fun </i> on our college campus. By automating the cutting, draining, and
                            crushing of plastic bottles in a single streamlined process, it is able to reduce common
                            barriers to recycling, like leftover liquids and the hassle of manual preparation.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p><b><u>Objective:</u> Address the inefficiencies in recycling plastic water bottles by creating an
                    automated solution that compresses bottles in an engaging way, reducing their volume, draining
                    residual liquids, and motivating people to recycle.</b></p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Simplify disposal process for the user</li>
                <li>2. Reduce waste volume, optimizing transportation and disposal</li>
                <li>3. Motivate users to recycle by improving engagement</li>

            <!-- Ideation Phase Section -->
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p><b>Step 1: identify and understand the problem space.</b></p>
            <br><br>
            <div class="project-content-left">
                <h3>Using Research to Confirm the Problem Exists</h3>
                <p>
                    Our secondary research confirmed that plastic bottle use remains high, while recycling rates remain
                    low, especially on CMU campus, where the meal plan always includes a plastic beverage bottle. My
                    team
                    confirmed this by observing a campus waste bin and counting the number of students who recycled
                    their bottles. Through this, we found that <b>over 81% of students do not recycle their bottles.</b>
                </p>
                <h3>Finding Pain Points: User Process and Competitor Study</h3>
                <p>Next, we explored the user process: what are the biggest barriers to recycling?
                    <br><br> We conducted a competitor study on a manual trash compactor to learn how other companies
                    tackle the problem of waste disposal, especially when there is food/beverage waste involved.

                    <br><br> <b> I conducted user studies using the competitor trash compactor and find pain points
                        amont
                        the users (college students). </b> I placed the trash compactor in my house kitchen, which is
                    shared by 4 college students. Although the trash compactor was not limited for only plastic bottles,
                    it was helpful in determining pain points in waste disposal. Particularly, the competitor product
                    was not intuitive to use, not structurally sound (parts broke off during normal use), and because it
                    is manual, it is not that much more effective than compacting with your hands. However, the users
                    appreciated the novelty of the product (it's fun to crush stuff!) and the added hygiene (don't need
                    to touch the waste).
                    <br><br> From this, we knew <b>our solution should be automatic, easy to use, and durable enough to
                        actually compact. </b>Other key ideas: integrating a liquid drainage system, ensuring a
                    one-button operation for ease of use, and incorporating the satisfaction of crushing stuff.

            <p>Next, we tackled our most critical design component: the crushing mechanism. Our initial approach
                used a
                linkage system, converting a motor or hand crank's rotational motion into the linear bottle-crushing
                motion. However, after I sketched and modeled it out, I noticed it took up a lot of space.</p>

            <p>So, we switched to an off-the-shelf linear actuator borrowed from the school. This was much more
                compact, with an appropriate range of motion for crushing a single bottle. It would also allow the user
                to easily control its motion via a 3-way switch by reversing the direction of the current. I hooked up
                the
                actuator to a makeshift breadboard 3-way switch and tested it with water bottles, an old PVC pipe, and
                very rudimentary mounting.

            <h2>Lo-Fi Prototyping</h2>
            <p>I built the rest of the prototype by manually machining scrap material in the woodshop/machine shop.
                <br><br>

                <u><b>Bottle Processing Procedure:</b></u> Next, my team debated: how are we incorporating the
                crushing
                mechanism? How are we mounting it? <br> I was a proponent for mounting it vertically; it would save
                countertop/floor space, gravity would help with crushing and drainage, and there would also be an
                added
                level of safety from the separation between the user and the internal crushing components. To
                demonstrate and communicate my idea to the rest of my team, I created some rough sketches, quick
                CAD,
                and created a lo-fi prototype.
            </p>

                </video>
            </div>
            <p>However, lo-fi prototyping also demonstrated an issue: we would need additional components to control
                the
                individual rotation of the platforms, and the platforms rotating in and out would still take up
                space as
                well.</p>

            <div class="gallery">
                <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Junk-Jenius/vertical-disproven-2.bmp"

            <p> So, we went with a horizontal mount, but made sure to include a slanted ramp to aid drainage, and a
                safety separation between the user's hand and the crushing component.</p>
                <h2>Stress Analysis</h2>
            <p><br><br>Another issue we tackled was <b>prototype durability</b>. The linear actuator we were using
                was
                rated for 200lbf, and we found it took ~50lbf to crush a water bottle (factor of safety = 4). The
                next
                weak point was the pipe with the cutouts. Although the cutouts were a little suspicious, we did hand
                calcs and FEA to ensure it would hold. And finally, the linear actuator mount went through several
                iterations, changing the shape to be thicker, have a wider footprint, and finally changing the
                material
                to counteract the torsional stress caused by the position and forces the mount would experience.
            </p>

                Finally, for the draining portion, my team went through several iterations of the blades. I
                contributed by testing different locations in CAD and seeing what would be feasible to machine in our
                shop, and also providing suggestions on what would effectively puncture the plastic. The blade was then
                created out of scrap metal pipe that was then manually milled and sharpened on a grinder. Through
                testing, we modified it so that the curve of the points would allow the blade to pierce the bottle
                without getting stuck on it when it retracts. I constructed the hollow ramp to help drained liquids
                to flow out of the machine, which also houses the bulk of the electronic components for a cleaner look.
                The
                chute is long enough to hold multiple bottles, enabling rapid-fire crushing.
                <br> Safety measures: by default, the machine is "off" and only operates as long as the user holds
                the
                switch down. Also, the only user-facing components are the bottle insertion chute, the operation
                switch,
                and the hold that the crushed bottle drops out of. Everything else (moving components, blades,
                crushing
                chamber) is covered. So, we knew it was safe to allow anyone to use.

            <p>As a final touch, I designed a final mockup for the Expo, incorporating Pittsburgh iconography to
                resonate with our local campus users. The blade holder is shaped like Pittsburgh's iconic red bus,
                holding the blades as a "snowplow" that will crash through and destroy the water bottles. As the
                mechanism operates, the bus zooms through Pittsburgh’s iconic bridges (aka the linear actuator
                mounts),
                while the outer frame mirrors the city's hilly skyline. The front wall is constructed from clear
                acrylic, allowing users to watch the satisfying destruction. We showcased this interactive prototype
                and
                mockup during the 2024 CMU Engineering Design Expo, receiving a lot of positive reactions! In
                addition
                to our group's pitch and explanation of the project, we gave live demos of the machine actually
                crushing
                a variety of bottles and allowed people to try it themselves too. By popular vote amongst attendees,
                our
                project was awarded "Best Prototype," validating its creativity, functionality, and broad appeal. It
                was
                well-received during user testing, with feedback highlighting its creativity and interactivity with
                users, and functional potential to enhance recycling rates in public spaces. </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>


            <p>
                As my final engineering capstone project, this was a very exciting experience. I felt that I was an
                integral and essential part of this team, and was proud of my contributions in CAD design,
                prototyping,
                and general teamwork. The most satisfying part was seeing our concept evolve into a functional
                prototype
                that not only addressed a real-world problem we saw around us, but brought an element of joy to its
                users. I think it resonated with our audience because it was relevant to them and it was fun.
                Because
                our school is in Pittsburgh, everyone could relate to the iconic local elements. The
                Pittsburgh-inspired
                aesthetic design and interactive functionality helped make the machine not just practical but also
                enjoyable to use. If we had more time, I would probably want to focus on further developing the
                prototype's visuals to match the mockups, include more interactive elements like displaying how many
                bottles it has recycled, and streamlining the manufacturing process to reduce material waste. But
                all in
                all, given our time and resource constraints, I am extremely happy with the final product!</p>
