                            The Junk Jenius: Plastic Bottle Recycling Machine is a project designed to make recycling <i>easy, accessible, and fun </i>in public spaces (i.e. on our college campus). By automating the cutting, draining, and crushing of plastic bottles in a single streamlined process, it is able to reduce common barriers to recycling, like leftover liquids and the hassle of manual preparation.

                            My contributions were the <b>CAD design</b> and the majority of the <b>prototype build</b>, with a focus on reclaiming scrap materials for sustainability and making our machine fun and engaging. I built the prototype using primarily woodshop and manual machining practices. I also designed a final mockup to include Pittsburgh-inspired iconography to connect with our local users. During the Carnegie Mellon Engineering Expo, our project won <b>"Best Prototype,"</b> validating our project's functionality, creativity, and mass appeal.</p>

            <!-- Project Goals Section -->
            <h4>Project Goals</h4>
            <p>Objective: Address the inefficiencies in recycling plastic water bottles by creating an automated solution to compress bottles, reducing their volume, while draining residual liquids.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Simplify the disposal process for the user</li>
                <li>2. Reduce waste volume to optimize transportation and disposal</li>
                <li>3. Motivate users to recycle by improving engagement</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Ideation Phase Section -->
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>Our brainstorming sessions focused on identifying barriers to recycling and designing a machine that addresses these issues. Initial sketches explored automation, hygiene, and durability. Key ideas included integrating a liquid drainage system and ensuring a one-button operation for ease of use.</p>

            <h3>Main Mechanism Prototyping</h3>
            <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Junk-Jenius/presentation-main-mechanism.png" alt="Prototype Image 1" class="project-image">

            <div class="gallery">

            </div>
            <p>The first thing my team tackled was the most critical component: the crushing mechanism. Our initial approach used a linkage system that would convert a motor or hand crank's rotational motion into the linear motion, to crush the bottle. However, after sketching and drawing it out, it used more space than we would like.</p>
<br>

                <p>So, we simplified the design to use an old off-the-shelf linear actuator borrowed from the school. This linear actuator was much more compact, with an appropriate range of motion for crushing a single bottle. The linear actuator would allow the user to easily control its motion via a 3-way switch. We tested the actuator with water bottles and very rudimentary mounting, and decided this solution would work!

            <!-- Final Result Section -->
            <h3>Final Result</h3>
            <p> We developed several prototypes, refining the design with each iteration. The final prototype includes a PVC chute for bottle insertion, a linear actuator for cutting and crushing, and a slanted ramp for liquid drainage. The process involved CAD modeling, 3D printing, and assembly using machine shop tools. The Pittsburgh-inspired design, featuring bridge-like structural elements, added a playful and local identity to the project, enhancing user engagement.
                
                The final design successfully integrates cutting, draining, and crushing into a single compact machine. It was well-received during user testing, with feedback highlighting its convenience and potential to enhance recycling rates in public spaces. The Pittsburgh-inspired aesthetic design and interactive functionality helped make the machine not just practical but also enjoyable to use.</p>

            <!-- Reflection Section -->
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in CAD design, prototyping, and team collaboration. The most rewarding aspect was seeing our concept evolve into a functioning prototype that addresses a real-world problem. Winning "Best Prototype" at the Engineering Expo was a proud moment, validating our hard work and creativity. Future iterations will focus on optimizing durability and exploring renewable energy integration.</p>
