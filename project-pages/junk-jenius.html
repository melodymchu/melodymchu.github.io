            <h4>Project Goals</h4>
            <p><b><u>Objective:</u> Address the inefficiencies in recycling plastic water bottles by creating an automated solution that compresses bottles in an engaging way, reducing their volume, draining residual liquids, and motivating people to recycle.</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Simplify the disposal process for the user</li>
                <li>2. Reduce waste volume to optimize transportation and disposal</li>
                <li>3. Motivate users to recycle by improving engagement</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Ideation Phase Section -->
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p><b>First step: identify and understand the problem space.</b></p>
                <br><br>
                <div class="project-content-left">
                <p>
                Our secondary research confirmed that plastic bottle use remains high, while recycling rates remain low, especially on CMU campus, where meal blocks always include a plastic beverage bottle. My team confirmed this by observing a campus waste bin and counting the number of students who recycled their bottles. Through this, we found that <b>over 81% of students do not recycle their bottles.</b>
                <br><br>
                Next, we explored the user process: what are the biggest barriers to recycling? 
                <br><br>
                We conducted a competitor study on a manual trash compactor to learn how other companies tackle the problem of waste disposal, especially when there is food/beverage waste involved.
            
            <br>

        My role: conduct user studies using the competitor trash compactor and find pain points amont the users (college students). I placed the trash compactor in my house kitchen, which is shared by 4 college students. Although the trash compactor was not limited for only plastic bottles, it was helpful in determining pain points in waste disposal. Particularly, the competitor product was not intuitive to use, not structurally sound (parts broke off during normal use), and because it is manual, it is not that much more effective than compacting with your hands. However, the users appreciated the novelty of the product (it's fun to crush stuff!) and the added hygiene (don't need to touch the waste).
        <br>
        <br>
        From this, we knew that our solution should be automatic, easy to use, and durable enough to actually compact. Other key ideas: integrating a liquid drainage system, ensuring a one-button operation for ease of use, and incorporating the satisfaction of crushing stuff.

            <h3>Main Mechanism Prototyping</h3>
            <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Junk-Jenius/presentation-main-mechanism.png" alt="Prototype Image 1" class="project-image">

            </div>
            <p>Next, we tackled our most critical design component: the crushing mechanism. Our initial approach used a linkage system, converting a motor or hand crank's rotational motion into the linear motion, to crush the bottle. However, after sketching and drawing it out, it used more space than we would like.</p>
<br>
                <p>So, we simplified the design to use an old off-the-shelf linear actuator borrowed from the school. This linear actuator was much more compact, with an appropriate range of motion for crushing a single bottle. The linear actuator would allow the user to easily control its motion via a 3-way switch. We tested the actuator with water bottles, an old PVC pipe, and very rudimentary mounting, and decided this solution would work!

            <!-- Final Result Section -->
            <h3>Final Result</h3>
            <p> I developed several prototypes, refining the design with each iteration.                 with a focus on reclaiming scrap materials for sustainability and making our machine fun and engaging. I built the prototype using primarily woodshop and manual machining practices. I also designed a final mockup to include Pittsburgh-inspired iconography to connect with our local users. During the Carnegie Mellon Engineering Expo, our project won <u><b>"Best Prototype,"</b></u> validating our project's functionality, creativity, and mass appeal.
                The final prototype includes a PVC chute for bottle insertion, a linear actuator for cutting and crushing, and a slanted ramp for liquid drainage. The process involved CAD modeling, 3D printing, and assembly using machine shop tools. The Pittsburgh-inspired design, featuring bridge-like structural elements, added a playful and local identity to the project, enhancing user engagement.
                

                The final design successfully integrates cutting, draining, and crushing into a single compact machine. It was well-received during user testing, with feedback highlighting its convenience and potential to enhance recycling rates in public spaces. The Pittsburgh-inspired aesthetic design and interactive functionality helped make the machine not just practical but also enjoyable to use.</p>

            <!-- Reflection Section -->
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in CAD design, prototyping, and team collaboration. The most rewarding aspect was seeing our concept evolve into a functioning prototype that addresses a real-world problem. Winning "Best Prototype" at the Engineering Expo was a proud moment, validating our hard work and creativity. Future iterations will focus on optimizing durability and exploring renewable energy integration.</p>
