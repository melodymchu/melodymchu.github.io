        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p><strong>Project Goals:</strong> To practice cutting and etching on a material (paper), and to learn Inkscape, a 2D vector drawing package.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Made out of paper (index card material), approximately 2.25" x 3.75".</li>
            <li>Includes name and contact information.</li>
            <li>At least one cut all the way through (excluding the card's perimeter) and one etched or raster engraved portion.</li>
            <li>Contains at least one fold to bring the design from 2D to 3D.</li>
            <li>Present design at the class showcase.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Ideation Section -->
        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>I started by sketching different ideas, focusing on how to incorporate my name and the folding 3D aspect. I aimed for a design that would work well in both 2D and 3D forms, with a simple, clean, and cute style. I wanted something that would stand out at a distance if displayed on a table at a professional event or job fair.</p>
        <p>In my final design, my name was the most visible element, both flat and standing. I included stylized flowers in a simple "gear train" configuration at the bottom, which also functioned as the stand. I manually created a rough prototype to determine where to make cuts to ensure the design could stand upright.</p>

        <!-- Digitization Section -->
        <h3>Digitization</h3>
        <p>Next, I brought my sketch into Inkscape, a vector drawing program. Although I had never used Inkscape before, I found it somewhat similar to Illustrator, making it easy to learn. Thin red lines indicated full cuts, while black represented etching or raster areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Main Elements Used:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modified Polygons</li>
            <li>Edit paths by node</li>
            <li>Bezier Curves</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Manufacturing Section -->
        <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
        <p>With the vector design completed, I began testing on the laser cutter. Initially, I expected the process to be straightforward, but several issues arose. The counters (the holes in letters like "e," "o," and "d") fell through because I had not accounted for them. Additionally, the etching was too light and fuzzy, and the cuts did not always go through completely.</p>
        <p>To resolve these issues, I added bridges to the letter counters in Inkscape and adjusted the laser cutter settings (speed and power) to achieve a cleaner result.</p>

        <!-- Final Result Section -->
        <h3>Final Result</h3>
        <p>I enjoyed designing a business card for myself and developing new laser-cutting skills, such as cutting with paper and creating 3D folds. My previous laser-cutting experience was primarily focused on practical parts for engineering classes, like acrylic trusses and wooden mounts. This project allowed me to experiment with visual techniques like etching and apply concepts from my Communication Design class, such as hierarchy and typography. It was also my first experience cutting with paper, which taught me about its material properties, like foldability, flexibility, color change, and potential burning.</p>
        <p>During the showcase, I appreciated seeing various approaches, including etched vectorized photographs and "punch-and-assemble" type projects. Ultimately, I was pleased with my final design and hope to explore more decorative and paper-based laser-cutting in the future.</p>

        <!-- Reflection Section -->
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This project was a valuable learning experience in combining digital design skills with hands-on fabrication techniques. It provided insights into the laser-cutting process and allowed me to explore creative applications for business card design. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and further developing my understanding of material properties and laser-cutting capabilities.</p>
