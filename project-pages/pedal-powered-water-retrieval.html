                    <!-- Project Description -->
                    <p class="project-description">In this Fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering course project, I collaborated with a team to research, design, model, and analyze a device that digs a water well powered by a human pedaling a bicycle. Our solution is specifically designed for the Baalbek-Hermel region of Lebanon, which faces significant challenges with clean water accessibility due to poor infrastructure and economic difficulties.</p>

        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>The main problem addressed is clean water accessibility in the Baalbek-Hermel region of Lebanon, where political gridlock, economic collapse, and insufficient infrastructure have made access to clean water scarce. Our proposed solution is a pedal-powered water-well drill that can be assembled and disassembled by a small team and transported via a regular-sized truck. This device uses human pedaling power to operate a drill, enabling villagers to create wells independently.</p>

        <!-- Conceptual Design Section -->
        <h3>Conceptual Design</h3>
        <p>Our design consists of three main sections: the bike (providing input torque), the gear housing (amplifying torque), and the drill and pulley system (controlling the drilling process). The drill is operated by pedaling a modified bicycle, which powers a gear system that drives the drill bit into the ground. The entire setup is designed to be easily transportable and operable by a single user, addressing the needs for safety, ease of use, and affordability.</p>

        <!-- Design Process Section -->
        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>Our design process involved sketching several concepts, conducting a detailed CAD model, and performing stress and dynamic analyses to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. We also conducted a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on the pedal to assess its structural integrity under the applied forces.</p>

        <!-- Final Design and Results Section -->
        <h3>Final Design and Results</h3>
        <p>The final design is a robust, three-section mechanism combining a bicycle, a gear housing, and a drill with a pulley system. While the design met most of our objectives, we identified areas for further improvement, such as optimizing transportability and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, unexpected issues, such as bending of the crankshaft and discrepancies in the input force data, were noted during analysis, indicating the need for further refinement.</p>

        <!-- Reflection Section -->
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This project taught us valuable lessons in engineering design, teamwork, and project management. We learned the importance of accurate data, iterative design, and addressing customer needs effectively. Moving forward, we would focus on further refining our design to better meet all criteria, including transportability, cost, and ease of use.</p>
