                            Murakami's iconic flower motif. The end result was a design system, magazine spread, and an

            <h4> Feature Content </h4>
            <p>The article I chose, <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/takashi-murakami-flower-nfts-interview"
                    target="_blank">"Takashi Murakami’s Iconic Flowers Are Becoming NFTs"</a>, is about Japanese
                contemporary artist Takashi Murakami debuting an NFT collection called Murakami.Flowers, which consists
                of 11,664 unique flower designs, featuring his iconic smiling flower motif in a pixelized style. In an
                interview, he discusses his new exploration of digital mediums and how art interacts with the metaverse.
            </p>
            <p><a

            </p><br>
            <p>After reading the article and analyzing the images, I wanted to highlight the
                <b>boldness and cuteness</b> of his art style and draw upon the idea of <b>“digitization”</b> with
                inspiration from <b>8-bit retro games and pixel art.</b> Murakami's previous works, especially those
                with flower motifs, often show a street art/pop art influence, with a
                <b>bright, cute, psychedelic, and subversive look.</b></p><br>

            <!-- Developing the Design System Section -->
            <h3>Developing a Design System</h3>
            <p>Initial Moodboards: Based on the research and inspiration collected into Pinterest moodboards, I explored
                3 potential directions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Street</strong>: Inspired by dark, bold streetwear/street art but with a cleaner,
                    digitized feel.</li>
                <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Murakami-Flowers/Digital-Street-Moodboard.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">

                <br><br><li><strong>Cutesy 8-Bit</strong>: Inspired by 8-bit retro games and pixel art, with a bright,
                    simplistic, and cute feel.</li>
                <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Murakami-Flowers/Cutes-8-bit-Moodboard.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">

                <br><br><li><strong>Psychedelic</strong>: Draws upon dreamy, melty, and subversive works with lots of organic
                    swirly lines.</li>
                <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Murakami-Flowers/Psychedelic-Moodboard-1.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">
                <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Murakami-Flowers/Psychedelic-Moodboard-2.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">

            </ul>
            <h4>Design System Iterations</h4>

            <p>I decided to combine the first 2 directions into “8-Bit Street” featuring bright, modern colors in a
                pixelized/retro video game aesthetic. The final color scheme used pink, blue, and green to evoke a
                bright, playful, cutesy vibe - reminiscent of flowers and nature, yet distinctly neon and digital. I
                also used more digital-looking fonts and included more pixel-art iconography.</p>

            <h4>Design System Critique</h4>
            <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Murakami-Flowers/Neon-8-Bit-Critique.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">
            <p>My system had 5 votes from the class for a successful color scheme, and I received feedback that the
                header font and color palette did fit the theme and the subject successfully. I was also told to think
                more about what types of elements to include for graphics, since I currently only have a few photographs
                from the article, but maybe I could include icons for visual flourish, for instance, one suggestion was
                a graph, like how NFT value is often represented in graphs. I think moving forward I’d like to work more
                on finding better typefaces for the subheader, body text, and quote to better fit the digital style.</p>

            <!-- Instagram Ad Section -->
            <h3>Creating the Instagram Ad</h3>
            <h4>Instagram Ad Sketches</h4>
            <p> For these three thumbnail sketches, I had 3 main ideas. The first idea was to make it look like a screen
                from a cutesy 8-bit video game, with pixelized flowers and a little "landscape" with grass and sky. The
                second idea is based on Murakami's previous flower pieces, which often show a collage of overlapping
                flowers. In this idea, all of the flower's faces would be facing towards the main text, which has the
                actual ad information. The third was a simpler design with the text as the main focus, and two flowers
                embellishing it.</p>
            <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Murakami-Flowers/Instagram-Ad-Sketches.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">

            <h4>Instagram Ad First Digitization</h4>
            <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Murakami-Flowers/Instagram-Ad-First-Iteration.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">
            <br><p>For the Instagram ad, I ended up going in the 1st sketch direction of a pixelized landscape background in
                a video game, because it would be too difficult to source/create different angles of the NFT's for the
                2nd design, and I wasn't as excited about the 3rd design. I decided to make my ad promote the Gagosian
                Museum Exhibit, “An Arrow Through History”, mentioned in the article, which showcases a lot of the
                Murakami.Flowers collection. The ad's concept is a video game screen, with a pixelized highlight and a
                black border being a screen. I used the pinks, blues, and greens from my color palette and the same
                fonts from my design system</p>


            <!-- Making the Magazine Section -->
            <h3>Making the Magazine</h3>
            <h4>Initial Sketches (Grid System)</h4>

            <p>To start on the magazine, I sketched out 3 different layouts, each with different grid systems (modular,
                manuscript, 2-column) for breadth of exploration. With modular and manuscript, I had a clearer plan for
                them (e.g. the center spread could be a collage of the NFT’s with a pull quote in the middle). I also
                felt that there was more space to work within those grid systems: I could move visuals and text around
                with modular, and I could use the margins for visuals in manuscript. I also began finding visuals for
                the magazine, primarily sourcing icons from the Noun Project. I tried to find pixel art and
                digital-looking icons, since they're reminiscent of the collection's style.</p>
            <img src="https://melodymchu.github.io/images/Murakami-Flowers/Sample-Magazine-Iconography.png" alt="Magazine Sketches" class="project-image">
            <p><i><b>Feedback:</b> Agreed on using 1st 2 layouts (playful/dynamic but different from each other). Also received positive feedback on collages of the NFT’s to showcase variety of his work. Be careful of text in centerfold! Could be an issue with physical stapling and bounding. Think about how elements will interact with the physical fold in the center</i>

                <small>Initial Magazine Layout Sketches</small>
            <h4>Digitizing the Magazine Spreads</h4>

            <p>I then started digitizing the magazine grid layout sketches, implementing the chosen typefaces, and
                testing the placement of images. The initial digitization is kept in greyscale this week to focus more
                on placement.</p>

                3 votes for successful color, 2 for hierarchy, and 1 for typeface

                Make text smaller, make text pages white to improve readability

                Focus on the story/flow (e.g. process photos)

                Make interview spread more playful to match other spreads

                Will put more thought into placement of pages/elements, and better visuals.</p>

            <p><i><small>Printed Spreads at Critique</p></i></small>

            <h4>Continuing Magazine Iteration:</h4>
<p>
I made several changes in this iteration of the magazine to try to make the magazine more visually dynamic and include more photos/iconography.
<ul>
<li>Switched out 1st Murakami intro photo to a more dynamic/excited one</li>

<li>Made text smaller and increased margin size to make room for captions/iconography</li>

<li>Made ghost flowers overlap the page seam to be less rigid</li>

<li>Added author’s name and a photo of the Gagosian gallery (pg 3)</li>

<li>I also added more pixelized iconography on pages 4–5, both sourced from the Noun Project, and original. For the original elements, I used Illustrator to trace out one of the flower outlines using squares in two shades. I tried to include more pixelized nature elements, like flowers and clouds, to tie in with the Instagram ad’s theme. I also changed the last spread to be one collage of the NFT’s, and one pull-quote with the pixelized flower kind of deteriorating at the edges. I feel like this iteration was much more dynamic and was trying to convey the pixelized theme more.</li>
</ul>

            <p><i><small>Miro Feedback on New Iteration</small></p></i>

            <p>This iteration was also put in Miro for more detailed annotated feedback. In general, the instructor
                liked that the photography is more narrative, but some placements/styling are making the spreads
                unbalanced or harder to engage with (e.g. readability of vertical caption - pg 2, ghost flowers too big
                - pg. 3). Pages 4–5 also look a bit awkward/cluttered, which she agrees with, and she suggested
                simplifying the layout of the visuals, by including less iconography and using them just as accents, and
                placing the images in line with the text to look neater. She also suggested making the final spread,
                pages 6–7 white to match the rest of the inside pages.</p>

            <!-- Magazine Iterations and Feedback Section -->
            <h3>Magazine Iterations and Feedback</h3>
            <p>Feedback emphasized the need for better visual balance and readability. Adjustments were made to the
                magazine spreads to enhance visual dynamics, include more iconography, and refine text placement and
                size for improved engagement.</p>
