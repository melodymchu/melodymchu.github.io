                    <p class="project-description">In Communication Design Fundamentals, I developed a visual communication design system for Murakami.Flowers, an NFT collection created from Takashi Murakami's iconic flower motif. The end result was a design system, magazine spread, and accompanying Instagram advertisement.</p>

        <!-- Ideation Phase Section -->
        <h3>Ideation Phase - Exploring Feature Content and Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Feature Content: The article I chose, <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/takashi-murakami-flower-nfts-interview" target="_blank">"Takashi Murakami’s Iconic Flowers Are Becoming NFTs"</a>, is about Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami debuting an NFT collection called Murakami.Flowers, which consists of 11,664 unique flower designs, featuring his iconic smiling flower motif in a pixelized style. In an interview, he discusses his new exploration of digital mediums and how art interacts with the metaverse.</p>
        <p>After reading the article and analyzing the images, I wanted to highlight the boldness and cuteness of his art style and draw upon the idea of “digitization” with inspiration from 8-bit retro games and pixel art. Murakami's previous works, especially those with flower motifs, often show a street art/pop art influence, with a bright, cute, psychedelic, and subversive look.</p>

        <!-- Developing the Design System Section -->
        <h3>Developing a Design System</h3>
        <p>Initial Moodboards: Based on the research and inspiration collected into Pinterest moodboards, I explored 3 potential directions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital Street</strong>: Inspired by dark, bold streetwear/street art but with a cleaner, digitized feel.</li>
            <img src="images/Murakami-Flowers/Digital-Street-Moodboard.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">

            <li><strong>Cutesy 8-Bit</strong>: Inspired by 8-bit retro games and pixel art, with a bright, simplistic, and cute feel.</li>
            <img src="images/Murakami-Flowers/Cutes-8-bit-Moodboard.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">

            <li><strong>Psychedelic</strong>: Draws upon dreamy, melty, and subversive works with lots of organic swirly lines.</li>

            <img src="images/Murakami-Flowers/Psychedelic-Moodboard-2.png" alt="Design System" class="project-image">

        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, I decided to combine the first two directions into “8-Bit Street,” featuring bright, modern colors in a pixelized/retro video game aesthetic. The final color scheme used pink, blue, and green to evoke a playful, digital vibe, reminiscent of both flowers and nature, yet distinctly neon and modern.</p>

        <!-- Design System Critique Section -->
        <h3>Design System Critique</h3>
        <p>Feedback received highlighted that the color scheme and header font were successful in fitting the theme. It was suggested to consider more graphic elements, such as icons for visual flourishes, and to refine typefaces for subheaders and body text to better match the digital style.</p>

        <!-- Instagram Ad Section -->
        <h3>Creating the Instagram Ad</h3>
        <p>For the Instagram ad, I chose a direction inspired by a pixelized landscape background in a video game, utilizing the pinks, blues, and greens from my color palette. The ad concept was a video game screen promoting the Gagosian Museum Exhibit, “An Arrow Through History,” which showcases the Murakami.Flowers collection.</p>

        <!-- Making the Magazine Section -->
        <h3>Making the Magazine</h3>
        <p>Initial Sketches: Different layouts were sketched using various grid systems (modular, manuscript, 2-column) to explore diverse visual approaches. The design iterations focused on creating dynamic and engaging layouts that could visually communicate the narrative of Murakami's NFT collection.</p>

        <h3>Magazine Iterations and Feedback</h3>
        <p>Feedback emphasized the need for better visual balance and readability. Adjustments were made to the magazine spreads to enhance visual dynamics, include more iconography, and refine text placement and size for improved engagement.</p>
